Short notes on Streaming:

Streaming data is data that is generated continuously by thousands of data sources, which typically send in the data records simultaneously, and in small sizes. 
Streaming data includes a wide variety of data such as log files generated by customers using your mobile or web applications, ecommerce purchases, in-game player 
activity, information from social networks, financial trading floors, or geospatial services, and telemetry from connected devices or instrumentation in data centers.


Limitations of Serverless Stream Processing:

Serverless stream processing is increasingly becoming a vital part of decision-making engines. However, with the current set of features, itâ€™s not the ideal solution 
for some scenarios. Implementing real-time analytics for sliding windows and temporal event patterns is not a course for the faint-hearted. Stream Processing often uses 
a time-based or record-based window to be processed in contrast to the batch-based processing, which can lead to challenges in use cases that require query re-execution.
Nowadays, application requirements grow beyond aggregated analytics. Increasing the window size seems to be an appropriate temporary solution, but it develops another 
intractable problem - Memory Management. Modern day solutions usually provide advanced memory management and scheduling techniques to overcome this, but the world will 
see further improvements.
